# 👶 Infant Cry Classification Web App

A web application for classifying infant cries using a machine learning or deep learning model. Users can upload an audio sample of a baby crying, and the app will predict the type of cry along with a confidence score and visualizations.

## 📦 Requirements

### 🔧 Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors numpy librosa matplotlib soundfile scikit-learn tensorflow
```

> ⚠️ If you're only using a scikit-learn model (`.pkl`), you can skip installing TensorFlow.

### 💻 System Dependencies

Some Python packages rely on system-level libraries.

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1 ffmpeg
```

#### macOS

```bash
brew install libsndfile ffmpeg
```

### pip
```bash
pip install soundfile  # For libsndfile
pip install ffmpeg-python  # For ffmpeg
```

#### Windows

Most dependencies should work with pip, but if you run into issues, consider using Anaconda or install precompiled wheels from:

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Run XAMPP

Start **Apache** using the XAMPP Control Panel.

### 2. Set Up Project Folder

Place this project folder inside your XAMPP `htdocs` directory. Example path:

```bash
C:/xampp/htdocs/infant_cry_classification
```

### 3. Run the Python Backend

Open a terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask backend will start on:

```
http://localhost:8800
```

### 4. Open the Web App in Browser

In your browser, go to:

```
http://localhost/infant_cry_classification/index.php
```

### 5. Upload an Audio Sample

Use the form on the page to upload a `.wav` audio file of a baby cry. The app will return a prediction, confidence level, and visualizations.

## ✨ Features

- Upload `.wav` audio files for infant cry classification  
- Real-time audio analysis via Flask API  
- Works with both **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** models  
- Visual output of waveform and spectrogram  
- Clean API response for integration with other tools
